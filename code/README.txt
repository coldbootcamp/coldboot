Please read all instructions below before doing anything.


This directory has few files and directories - 

1. Directory - kernel_module/ - This directory is a initial test kernel module. We wrote this as a first kernel module program. Its not integrated with any of the AES functionality which we tried to develop. But its good to see to learn about how to write the kernel module. You are most welcome to look at them.


2. Directory - mod_aes/ - This is the ONE which we were trying to develop fully as a AES encryption decryption kernel module. We were facing problem to compile this kernel module because of the presence of global variables and *.S files. Future development work should extend this work. This directory is the most important for our future work.


3. Directory - mod_aes_old/ - As the name suggests this was one of the older version of mod_aes. Currently I do not have any Idea what is inside it.


4. Rest of the files (.c, .h etc.) are just some initial implementation of various things which we were trying to do... You are most welcome to look at them


All the best
